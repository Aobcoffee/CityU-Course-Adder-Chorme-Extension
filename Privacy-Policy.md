# CityU Course Adder Chrome Extension Privacy Policy
This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the CityU Course Adder Chrome Extension ("Extension"). By using the Extension, you implicitly agree to the terms of this Policy.

## 1. Personal Information
When you use the Extension, we do not collect, store, transmit or share any personal information about you or relating to your use of the CityU Course Adder Chrome Extension.

## 2. Local Storage
As a functionality of the CityU Course Adder Chrome Extension, we use Chrome local storage to store and recall your CRNs. These CRNs are only stored locally and are only used by the Extension for its course-adding functionality. They are not transmitted or shared with any other parties or services.

## 3. Responsibility
The Extension is designed to aid in the course add/drop process by pre-filling the CRNs in the extension popup and recalling them once you are on the Add/Drop webpage in the Aims student portal. However, we bear no responsibility or liability for any mistakes, discrepancies or issues that arise from the use of this Extension, including, but not limited to, course drop/add failures or inaccuracies. We strongly encourage users to double-check their course selections and additions—even while using the Extension—to ensure accuracy.

## 4. Unofficial Status
The Extension has been developed independently and is not officially associated or endorsed with/by City University of Hong Kong. As such, any and all issues, queries or discussions regarding the Extension should be directed to the developers, not the University.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will post them on our site and will indicate the date the changes were made.
