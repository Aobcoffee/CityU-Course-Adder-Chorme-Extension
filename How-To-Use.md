# How to use Quick Course Adder Extension?

## 1. Save the CRNs
Look up the course catalogues for CRN(s), then paste them into the Quick Course Adder Extension popup. Typically, CRN is a 5-digit number representing each section of the course.

Tips: Remember to have all CRNs for every module (Class, Lab, Tutorial, Seminar) in the course to prevent link errors. [Learn more](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/arro/content.asp?cid=155) on the introductory course Add/Drop from CityU's ARRO page.

## 2. Go to "Add or Drop Classes" in AIMS early
Before your time ticket for Add/Drop begins, log in to AIMS (Student Portal) and go to "Course Registration." Tap > "Main Menu for Web Add/Drop" > "Add or Drop Classes." If you are early, you should see the Time Ticket there.

## 3. Keep Refreshing the "Add or Drop Classes" page
Once your registration time (shown in time ticket is about to begin, e.g. 10 seconds before), refresh the page to ensure you get right into the Add/Drop form in the very first minute to secure the seat.

## 4. Submit the "Add or Drop Classes" form with auto-paste CRNs
Once you land on your "Add or Drop Classes" form, where you typically need to copy and paste the CRNs one by one manually, you should see the CRNs already filled for you by this extension. Double-check your filled CRNs, then click the "Submit Changes" button at the bottom of the form to send out the request. 

## 5. (If Any) Clear out your first 10 CRNs, Refresh and Redo step 4 
Since the "Add or Drop Classes" form in AIMS allows you to paste up to 10 CRNs at a time, if you have more than 10 CRNs stored in the extension, you need to clear that out by clicking the "remove the initially entered 10 CRNs" button on the attachment popup. Then, refresh the "Add or Drop Classes" form and redo step 4.
